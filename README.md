GearMaster - 1000


the overall goal is simply to get started with c++ development.
so, this application should not do any fancy new challenging things...


long term goal:
a gui application in which one can manage outdoor gear.
basically a gui accessor to a database.

## DONE
Mark I:
Cmake hello world

Mark II:
main application provides output.
main application can be interacted with. i.e.
- the user is prompted with a set of possible actions.
- if an action is given, the application acts accordingly

## TODO
Mark III:
input can be taken from the user, to create in memory objects

Mark IV:
current configuration can be saved to a file

Mark V:
saved files can be opened and continued to work with.


Mile stone 1:
the application is now able to open/save a inventory list to a file.
the application state can be saved and managed.


Possible continuations from Mile stone 1
- proceed to make a gui application
- integrate with an sqlite solution
- invent features such as
  - packinglists
  - hike diaries
  - notes on gear
  - gear wish lists
  - gear log (like current state, when it was used latest, good things/bad things etc)


epic squirrel, devious plan:
migrate GearMaster to a mobile app and build a webshop that sells gear.
integrate the webshop inventory to the app.




stuff:
- a logger
- unit tests
